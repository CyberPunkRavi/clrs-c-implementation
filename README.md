# CLRS C implementation
Algorithm implementation in *Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)*.

I implemented most of algorithms in CLRS in 2011. I record those explanation and details in my [blog][1].

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at liwei.day[at]gmail.com

# 算法导论代码实现
2011年时，曾经实现过《算法导论》里的绝大多数代码，并且在[博客][1]中记录了详解。
